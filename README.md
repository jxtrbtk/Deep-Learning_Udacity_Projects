# Deep Learning Udacity Nanodegree Projects
Projects done while following the courses of the Deep Learning Nanodegree at Udacity.com

## Predicting Bike-Sharing Patterns 
A neural network in NumPy to predict bike rentals.
## Dog Breed Classifier
Build a convolutional neural network with PyTorch to classify any image (even an image of a face) as a specific dog breed.
## TV Script Generation 
Train a recurrent neural network to generate scripts in the style of dialogue from Seinfeld.
## Face Generation
Use a DCGAN on the CelebA dataset to generate images of new and realistic human faces

__Derivated work / Faces video generation__ : [movie.py](https://github.com/jxtrbtk/Deep-Learning_Udacity_Projects/blob/master/04-Faces_Generation/movie.py)

The script build, train the model, save pictures of the tests set on a regular basis during training and then uses those picture to build a video showing the progress
